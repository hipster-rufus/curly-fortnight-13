## Installation
To install my project, you will need to clone my repository from GitHub onto your local directory by entering this code into your command line: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/hipster-rufus/curly-fortnight-13.git` <br>
Create the database in MySQL: <br>
`mysql -u root -p` <br>
`source db/schema.sql` <br>
`exit` <br>
Seed the database: <br>
`npm run seed` <br>
Then start the server: <br>
`npm start` <br>
This backend server allows the retail company to successfully retrieve, create, update, and delete data in a database. One simply sends their requests through Insomnia and are able to interact with the company's data as needed.
